## ‚öôÔ∏è Before You Deploy

Before you click **Deploy to Cloudflare**, make sure you have these accounts and services ready.

---

### üß± Must-Have Accounts & Services

| 1 | **Cloudflare** | Free | Base account for Workers + DNS | [Sign up free ‚Üí](https://dash.cloudflare.com) |
| 2 | **Cloudflare Workers + Workers Platform** | Paid | Hosts and orchestrates automations, logic, and UI for Codr + client apps | Platform owner requires paid plan |
| 3 | **R2 Buckets** | Free (Generous Tier) | Stores assets, bundles, transcripts, and media | Billing must be enabled |

| 6 | **GitHub** | Free | Hosts your code repo | Auto-connects during deploy |
| 7 | **Email Address** | Free / Paid | Authenticates user access, sends check-ins, and alert loops | Required for login and progress tracking |

---

### üíé Logic Models (LLM Options)

Codr defaults to **Gemini 2.5** (via Google AI Studio) for vibe-coding logic and app generation.  
You can optionally connect other models for specific strengths or preferences:

| Provider | Typical Use | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **OpenAI API Key** | Coding, frameworks, and persona libraries | Paid plan required |
| **Anthropic / Claude API Key** | Copywriting, ND-optimized logic | Optional |
| **Replicate API Key** | Image, avatar, video, or voice generation | Required for motion & visual agents |

---

### üì© Mail & Notifications

If your build uses **Loops** or **MailChannels** for alert routing or app check-ins, these keys are required ‚Äî not optional:

| Key | Purpose | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **MailChannels API Key** | Sends ND-friendly alerts and daily/weekly reminders | Used in code by default |
| **Authorized Email** | Access and registration on platform | Required for login and alert routing |

---

## üöÄ Quick Deploy

1. Log into Cloudflare (`wrangler login`)
2. Verify resources: `wrangler d1 list`, `wrangler kv:namespace list`
3. Deploy your worker:

        npm run deploy

4. Visit `https://vibecodedit.xyz` (or your own domain) and start vibe-coding your first agent üé®

> **Pro Tip:** If deployment fails, recheck your bindings and secrets in `wrangler.jsonc` before panic-scrolling support threads. Most errors come from missing keys or mismatched IDs.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è How Your Cloudflare Resources Map to the Code

When you click **Deploy to Cloudflare**, the platform automatically provisions and binds three key resources.  
Here‚Äôs how they connect to your code and power your micro-apps:

| Resource | Purpose | What It Powers |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **KV Namespace** | Caches quick lookup data | Makes wildcard subdomain routing instant |
| **D1 Database** | Stores agent registry, question sets, and style answers | Saves progress and enables ‚Äúresume later‚Äù |
| **R2 Bucket** | Holds generated bundles, uploaded screenshots, and assets | Keeps design inspiration and app UI files |

You don‚Äôt need to manually create these unless you‚Äôre replicating Codr for a team environment or customizing routing.  
Each resource maps automatically in `wrangler.jsonc` under bindings:
- `KV ‚Üí AGENT_CACHE`
- `D1 ‚Üí AGENT_REGISTRY_DB`
- `R2 ‚Üí AGENT_ASSETS`

---

## üí° What You Get
- **Chat UI (React, minimalist)** ‚Üí 6-question flow ‚Üí instant agent bundle  
- **Worker backend** ‚Üí KV ‚Üí D1 fallback, R2 bundles + Day 1/3/7 email reminders  
- **Sync to GitHub** (token) or **Download ZIP** fallback  
- **LLM picker** with smart defaults: Anthropic ‚Ä¢ Gemini ‚Ä¢ OpenAI ‚Ä¢ OpenRouter ‚Ä¢ Replicate (AV)  
- **Wildcard routing ready:** `*.vibecodedit.xyz/*` ‚Üí single router Worker

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you deploy, make sure you have:

- ‚úÖ A **Cloudflare account** with **Workers**, **D1**, **R2**, and **KV** enabled  
- ‚úÖ **Node 18+** installed locally (for testing or manual builds)  
- ‚úÖ A **verified domain** on Cloudflare (e.g., `yourdomain.xyz`)  

Add this CNAME record in your Cloudflare dashboard for your 'wildcard' workers:

```txt
Type:  CNAME
Name:  *
Target: yourdomain.xyz
TTL: Auto
Proxy: On (orange cloud)

This wildcard route allows every new micro-agent you build with Codr to automatically get its own subdomain like agent123.yourdomain.xyz.
```

---

## üîê Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `AI_GATEWAY` | Worker Var | Your single Cloudflare AI Gateway URL. All Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini requests funnel through here. |
| `GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY` | Secret | API key for Google AI Studio (used for front-end generation). |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Secret | Optional key for multi-model routing (Claude / OpenAI / Gemini). |
| `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` | Secret | Optional key for Replicate (audio, video, avatar, or image tasks). |
| `MAILCHANNELS_API_KEY` | Secret | Used for ND-friendly email alerts + performance check-ins. (Required for auth + alert features.) |

---

## ü§ñ LLM Defaults

Codr automatically inspects your ‚Äújob to be done‚Äù and selects a logic model stack based on task type and context.  
Defaults are pre-tuned for balance between capability and cost:

| Provider | Default | Budget Option |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Anthropic** | `claude-4-sonnet` (balanced generalist) | `claude-3.7-sonnet` |
| **OpenAI** | `gpt-5` (analysis & logic) | `gpt-5-mini` |
| **Gemini** | `gemini-2.5-pro` (vision/audio + UI builds) | `gemini-1.5-flash` |
| **Google AI Studio** | `code-davinci-ui` (front-end generator) | ‚Äî |
| **OpenRouter** | Mirrors chosen model | `openrouter/openai/gpt-5-mini` |
| **Replicate** | `elevenlabs-voice` (voice, AV, motion) | ‚Äî |

---

## üåê Routing & Domains

Each Codr app you create lives inside your Cloudflare environment with automatic routing baked in.

When you deploy:

| Route Type | Purpose | Example |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Root Domain** | The main Codr entry point and vibe-coding interface | `https://yourdomain.xyz` |
| **Wildcard Subdomains** | Auto-spins a unique preview for every micro-agent or app | `https://agent123.yourdomain.xyz` |
| **API Paths** | Handle logic calls and data persistence | `/api/agents`, `/api/assets`, `/api/style` |

### üß≠ How It Works

- **Wildcard routing** is powered by your CNAME record and Cloudflare DNS.  
  Once verified, every new agent you deploy instantly resolves to its own subdomain.  
- All app logic, UI assets, and user data are served through your Worker bindings (KV, D1, R2).  
- No manual routing setup or DNS edits after first deploy.

### üß© Domain Ownership Options

| Use Case | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Platform Owner / Builder** | Maintain paid **Workers Platform** plan and host client apps from your verified domain. |
| **Client / Individual User** | Connect your own Cloudflare domain (or subdomain) to the parent platform for easy self-hosted access. |

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Why This Matters

This setup ensures every Codr app has:
- Instant load speed via Cloudflare‚Äôs edge network  
- Seamless API calls (no CORS headaches)  
- Auto-generated sharing links for testing, feedback, and collaboration  

Your domain becomes both your **creative studio** *and* your **delivery engine** ‚Äî one click, full deploy.

## üñ•Ô∏è UI Flow

1. Visit `https://vibecodedit.xyz` (replace with your domain).  
2. **Answer the six functional questions** about the agent‚Äôs goal, steps, engagement, data, triggers, and follow-ups.  
3. **Define the look & feel**: theme, color palette, font, design vibe, motion effects, favorite app, and optional inspiration images.  
4. Review your summary, choose **Code it** or **Fix it**.  
5. Codr chooses React or Vite based on your style answers, generates the agent and its UI, registers it in D1, and assigns it a subdomain.  
6. Your agent is live at `https://<agent_id>.vibecodedit.xyz`.

Day 1/3/7 check-ins via email are sent automatically.

---

## üßØ Troubleshooting

- **KV/D1/R2 issues:** ensure IDs match your resources in `wrangler.jsonc`.  
- **Schema errors:** rerun migrations.  
- **Missing emails:** verify MailChannels configuration.  
- **API key greyed out:** set the corresponding secret.  
- **404 subdomain:** confirm wildcard route mapping.

---

## üé® ND-Friendly Style Guide

- Use **short, punchy copy** and one action per screen.  
- Prioritize **clear hierarchy** with contrasting colors; avoid clutter.  
- Limit pages to **60‚Äì85%** of the viewport, with generous whitespace.  
- Support *light* and *dark* themes.  
- Motion is optional; allow the user to choose none, subtle element animation, or page transitions.  
- Offer optional **favorite app** and **design inspiration uploads** so Codr can learn from designs that energize the user.
